1:03:00 Paragraph discussed from Ideal Money: " In a large state like one of
the "great democracies" it is reasonable to say that the people should be
able, in principle, to decide on the form of a money (like a "public utility")
that they should be served by, even though most of the actual volume of the
use of the money would be out of the hands of the great majority of the
people."
